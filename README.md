## Breakthru-Group-10

*** 
### Description

The aim of this project was to create a strategy game, together with an implementation of a human-human player version (and a human-computer player version, *not yet implemented at this moment*).
Our choice of game is **BreakThru**, a member of the Hnefatafl boardgame family. 

### User Instructions

To start this project, open and execute the "RunGUI.java" file as main class.
Once launched, a main menu will appear to guide the user. 
The instructions for the BreakThru game itself are described in detail at the 'Help' option in the main menu.
